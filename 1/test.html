	<h1>The Hollow City by Dan Wells</h1>h1>
	<p>The Hollow City is about a man called Michael Shipman who has paranoid schizophrenia. He sees and hears things that are not actually there, and believes that he is being haunted by faceless men. These delusions of his do not only ruin him completely but also link him to a series of murders happening at the time. He has to convince everyone that he is not guilty, but sometimes even himself doubts it.<
I started reading this book because of its author in the first place. I have already read two trilogies by Wells and during this period he became one of my favourite writers. I really enjoy the way he composes his novels, starting a bit slower and getting faster and faster as the mysteries unfold. He has this sense of humour as well which takes mental illnesses seriously and at the same time shows that these things are a lot more human than society makes them seem. 
I appreciate the fact that he obviously researches the topics he writes about too. For example in The Hollow City Michael gets medication for his illness, and I do not think that someone without a psychiatrist degree knows the names, the doses and the way they work. Wells clearly takes time to consult about the things he decides to include in his novels.
I would only recommend this book to someone who can bear more stressful and sometimes scary scenes.
